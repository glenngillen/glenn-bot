      "content": "I'm excited to help you explore your personal principles!\n\nFor this inquiry, I'll be applying the Design Thinking framework, specifically the \"Empathize\" step. This is because understanding your values and principles requires an empathetic approach that understands your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.\n\nTo start, let's \"empathize\" by exploring some questions together:\n\n1. What matters most to you in life?\n2. What are your non-negotiables when it comes to relationships or decisions?\n3. Are there any specific values or principles that you've adopted as a result of your experiences, upbringing, or personal growth?\n\nAs we explore these questions, I'll be listening actively and taking notes to help us better understand your perspectives.\n\nOnce we have a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and motivations, we can move on to the next steps in the Design Thinking process: defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. This will help us uncover more insights about your personal principles and how they shape your decisions and actions.\n\nHow does that sound?",
